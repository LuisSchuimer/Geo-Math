# geo-math

My small Project to display a coordinate-system in the console and interact with it.

## Commands
### 1. Add Point
- Enter `add p x,y` (Replace x,y with your coordinates) into the 'Commands' Tab
    - 'add' tells the program, to add something
    - 'p' tells the program, that a point is adressed
    - 'x,y' tells the programm, where to put the point in the coordinate-system
- Press 'Enter'

### 2. Zooming
- Tell the coordinate-system, how big the spaces between full numbers should be
- Enter `zoom x/y scale` (choose from x/y and replace 'scale' with your own value) into the 'Commands' Tab
    - 'zoom' tells the program, that you want to edit the coordinate-system
    - 'x/y' tells the program, which axis to edit
    - 'scale' tells the program, how big the spaces between full numbers should be
- Press 'Enter'

- Enter `zoom def` to return to the default zoom into the 'Commands' Tab
    - 'zoom' tells the program, that you want to edit the coordinate-system
    - 'def' tells the program, that you want to return to the defauld zoom
